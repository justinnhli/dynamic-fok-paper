Towards a Computational Model of a Feeling of Knowing

situating within a strategic knowledge search framework

    memory as a strategic process
        knowledge search (Newell1972HumanProblemSolving)
        "the Control of Recollection" (https://justinnhli.com/papers/b/Burgess1996ConfabulationAndThe.pdf)

    metamemory (https://justinnhli.com/papers/n/Nelson1990MetamemoryATheoretical.pdf)
        part of metamemory monitoring
        could be part of search strategy selection and search termination
    
    information foraging theory (Pirolli2007InformationForagingTheory)
        mostly addresses *external* sources of knowledge
        no conception of search strategy
        comparison with information scent

what is the role of FOK?

    necessary even without forgetting, since knowledge may not be there

    determined that cost doesn't matter to FOK, history of retrievals does (but not to our model), and history of fok is important to FOK and our model

    as conclusion from memory frameworks, FOK should be dynamic

    separate from search cost, from confidence of answer, from base "utility"/activation

    we differentiated between steps so far and queries so far but did not use queries so far since all of our retrievals only used one query, but now we are using multiple retrieval strategies if one fails/ multiple queries can be done for one retrieval, so maybe this is worth looking into?

non-FOK related work

    https://justinnhli.com/papers/s/Sharma2016ControllingSearchIn.pdf
        learning a heuristic for inference; uses similar features as what we consider below

    https://justinnhli.com/papers/s/Salvucci2015EndowingACognitive.pdf
        an ACT-R DBpedia paper we read, talks about triplet and chunk representations?

FOK related work

    fluency/ accessibility approach to FOK
        How Do We Know What We Know? Asher Koriat 1993: http://iipdm.haifa.ac.il/images/publications/Asher_Koriat/1993-Koriat-PR%20FOK.pdf
        - "two stage" explanation of FOK: initial FOK is based on cue-familiarity and subsequent FOKs are based on accessibility
        - According to Koriat, subsequent FOKs only occur after an incorrect answer is given, at the beginning of a new retrieval attempt. There is no mention of multiple FOKs occurring within a single retrieval.
            - So, he is not saying that FOK is dynamic but rather that one FOK occurs for every attampted retrieval in a retrieval process (i think??)

    accessibility and cue familiarity
        https://iipdm.haifa.ac.il/images/publications/Asher_Koriat/2001-KorLevySadot-JEPLMC.pdf
        - the accessibility and cue familiarity hypotheses for FOK are not mutually exclusive, but rather two distinct processes that contribute to overall FOK separately
        - experiment results contradict competition hypothesis
        - (i need to reread this because I'm not sure how it's different from koriat's 1993 paper above also discussing accessibility)

(Unhelpful?) FOK related work


modeling framework

    ACT-R, flat buffers, etc.

    parameter to choose whether things are activated on store or not
        - when did this make a difference?

    adding a huge number of nodes to kb (unrelated or related to queries)


static features of FOK (FIXME need references for all of these)
    
    for each one, review psychology literature
        then map onto ACT-R model and what that might look like

    cue familiarity (activation)

    speed of progress towards goal

    number of potential matches

    number of potential next elements (fan out)

    inverse of the number of distractors (competition fok)
        Schreiber & Nelson https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201170.pdf

    number of values associated with a certain concept (num edges)

    amount of info known about a result compared to everything else in memory?
        - mention using average activation (or other summary statistics)

complex/ conjugate features of fok
    - why it doesnt make sense if we can't explain meaning in the mind

dynamic features of FOK

    past FOKs?

    - used different FOK calculations based on where in the retrieval process the FOK occurred (using one method for a query and another method for subsequent retrievals)

evaluation metrics

    unclear what FOK should look like, for queries with and without answers

    need big dataset of questions and KB for evaluation?

    we claimed that FOK should be increasing when the correct answer is reached (positive slope), should decrease as you get farther from the correct answer, and should decrease when you give up
        - but is this necessarily true? we found that changes in FOK over time heavily depended on the individual question
        - (add examples)



----- bryce's unorganized notes of progress made over the summer-----

- recreated Liebert and Nelson's paired recall task, made 3 different representations (direct, pairs, types)
- since there is no standard for calculating fok, we recreated some basic ones (cue/ target familiarity)
- wanted to look at more complex retrievals with more steps and with more information in the kb to test FOK algorithms, so we coded up Jeopardy Qs
- created historic FOK (trend based)

Parameters we held constant:
act_decay_rate = [-0.25]
act_scale_factor = [0.5]
act_max_steps = [30]
act_capped = [True]
backlinks = [True]


maybe unrelated things we mentioned that still seem interesting:

- loooking at distance between different cues given to determine how likely you are to get an answer
- how to broaden a query/ how to factor in what the next, less-direct query is? ex. how would the agent know that a capital is often a large city
