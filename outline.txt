Towards a Computational Model of a Feeling of Knowing

situating within a strategic knowledge search framework

    memory as a strategic process
        knowledge search (Newell1972HumanProblemSolving)
        "the Control of Recollection" (https://justinnhli.com/papers/b/Burgess1996ConfabulationAndThe.pdf)

    metamemory (https://justinnhli.com/papers/n/Nelson1990MetamemoryATheoretical.pdf)
        part of metamemory monitoring
        could be part of search strategy selection and search termination
    
    information foraging theory (Pirolli2007InformationForagingTheory)
        mostly addresses *external* sources of knowledge
        no conception of search strategy
        comparison with information scent

what is the role of FOK?

    necessary even without forgetting, since knowledge may not be there

dynamic FOKs

    as conclusion from memory frameworks

    separate from search cost, from confidence of answer, from base "utility"/activation

non-FOK related work

    https://justinnhli.com/papers/s/Sharma2016ControllingSearchIn.pdf
        learning a heuristic for inference; uses similar features as what we consider below

modeling framework

    ACT-R, flat buffers, etc.

static features of FOK (FIXME need references for all of these)
    
    for each one, review psychology literature
        then map onto ACT-R model and what that might look like

    cue familiarity (activation)

    speed of progress towards goal

    number of potential matches

    number of potential next elements (fan out)

dynamic features of FOK

    past FOKs?

evaluation metrics

    unclear what FOK should look like, for queries with and without answers

    need big dataset of questions and KB for evaluation?
