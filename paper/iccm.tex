\section{Introduction}

\emph{Feelings of knowing} (FOKs) are a memory phenomenon in psychology where, despite not knowing the answer to a question, the subject might \emph{feel} that they will be able to retrieve the answer with more thought.
This and other metamemory phenomena, including \emph{tip-of-the-tongue states} and \emph{judgments of learning}, have long been studied as both a topic area of its own, as well as a way to gain insight into how memory is related to decision making \cite{Nelson1994WhyInvestigateMetacognition}.
The psychology literature have focused on both the situations that lead to changes in FOKs, as well as the underlying sources of the judgment.
More recently, researchers have proposed the \emph{cognitive-heuristic account} of metamemory: that FOK serves the \emph{function} of guiding memory retrieval \cite{Schwartz2011TipOfThe}, and to allow early failure without expending retrieval resources if the probability of finding an answer is low.

In parallel, the cognitive modeling community interested in modeling memory since the founding of the subfield.
Cognitive architectures like ACT-R \cite{Anderson2007HowCanThe} in part grew out of early models of declarative memory \cite{Anderson1983ASpreadingActivation, Anderson1991ReflectionsOfThe}, and to this day the mechanisms of base-level activation and spreading activation remain deeply embedded within multiple architectures.
While recognition and recall have been widely modeled, however, metamemory phenomena remain understudied, especially in the context of the broader strategic knowledge search \cite{Newell1972HumanProblemSolving}.
This paper therefore aims to complement existing literature by exploring how metacognitive judgment and control, and feelings of knowing in particular, might be modeled in a common model of cognitive architecture \cite{Laird2017AStandardModel}.
We begin by reviewing the literature on strategic knowledge search in order to place FOK in its ecological context, and identify a potential omission in our current understand of FOK.
We then briefly summarize the representation of memory in ACT-R, before committing the bulk of this paper to considering different possible sources of a computational FOK.
Finally, we conclude by discussing how such a model of FOK might be evaluated, especially given the subjective nature of such judgments in the psychological literature.

\section{Strategic Knowledge Search}

Knowledge search is the process of finding knowledge that is relevant and could be applied to the current problem solving context \cite{Newell1972HumanProblemSolving}. % FIXME knowledge search is also mentioned in the Soar book; need to look up what it says as well
Newell does not elaborate on the processes of knowledge search, and knowledge search has received scant exploration in contrast to problem space search.
At the same time, there has been a slow trickle of psychological research on not just individual memory retrievals, but how people use their memory system as a whole, and how problem solving and decision processes are intertwined with memory.
Experiments where subjects narrated their attempts at answering autobiographical questions, then elaborated on their thinking while listening to the recording, showed a rich landscape of memory processes \cite{Burgess1996ConfabulationAndThe}.
Beyond the actual recollection of an event, subjects also described determining the recall specifications, gauging their own familiarity with the subject, relating multiple relevant memories, and verifying that a potential answer is in fact correct.
Within psychology literature, a simplified version of this account is widely accepted, in that metacognitive judgments such as FOK are used for metacognitive control, such as selecting a search strategy and deciding whether to terminate search \cite{Nelson1990MetamemoryATheoretical}.
Only more recently has the causal relationship between FOK and search terminal been empirically studied \cite{Singer2008FeelingOfKnowing}, or how FOK plays a role in which items a test-taker might revisit for further study \cite{Hanczakowski2014FeelingOfKnowing}.
In sum, although strategic memory processes are \fixme[overusing generally, broadly, widely, etc. here]{generally} acknowledged to occur, neither psychology nor cognitive systems research has looked at how this broader context might inform our understanding of individual memory mechanisms.

And yet, it is in the context of knowledge search that FOK must be understood.
The cognitive-heuristic account of metamemory suggests that FOK guides memory retrieval, which in turn implies that it must provide meaningful information about the state and contents of memory. % FIXME something about signal to noise ratio here?
% FIXME FOK is necessary because...

% FIXME need to bring up the idea of multiple retrievals to answer a single question
% because the next thing to suggest is that FOK is dynamic, and changes per retrieval
One consequence of accepting knowledge search is the dissociation between a single memory retrieval with that of answering a question.
Both semantic and episodic/autobiographical questions may in fact require multiple memory retrievals, not all of which may be relevant or return results.
As an example, for a question like \question{What film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1999?}{\emph{Life is Beautiful}} \cite{Norman2016TheRelationshipBetween}, one might perform retrievals for general cultural events in 1999, famous directors and actors/actresses, generally acclaimed films, and so on.
This account complicates the study of FOK: about \emph{which} question is the subject feeling that they know the answer to?
When a subject reports their feeling of knowing, is it to the original question, or to any of the sub-questions that they ask themselves as they engage in the strategic search for the answer?

Here we propose that the reported FOK is to the original question, and not to any of the other retrievals for the search process.
This conclusion is more obvious for a question such as \question{What is the capital of Australia?}{Canberra}.
Most people will suggest answers such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane before giving up, but despite these successful retrievals for Australian cities, will report that their FOK goes down over time before they terminate their search.
That is, it seems clear to us that FOK is a \emph{dynamic} signal that changes throughout the strategic memory search process.
This is also consistent with the cognitive-heuristic account of FOK: in order for FOK to be a reliable signal for search termination, it \emph{must} change over the course of the process to reflect whether an answer is still likely to be found.
This stands in contrast to how FOK is usually studied: all psychological experiments we have been been able to find only solicit subjects' FOKs once, either before or after they are given the chance to attempt to answer the question. % FIXME are there studies that hint at the dynamic nature of FOK?
While we have no doubt that such reports of FOK will still be correlated with the state of memory, ignoring the time course of FOK will likely omit crucial aspects of how the signal is cognitive determined.

For the remainder of this paper, we will assume this dynamic view of FOK as we consider how FOK might be modeled computationally.

% FIXME relation to information foraging theory
% FIXME relation to information seeking behavior
% FIXME \cite{Nelson2008TowardsARational}
% This pattern of strategic retrieval processes is also found in human information seeking behavior \cite{Marchionini1995InformationSeekingIn}, although to our knowledge no formal comparison of these models have been done.

\section{Memory in the Common Model of Cognition}

The common model of cognition \cite{Laird2017AStandardModel} defines a set of representations and processes for modeling cognition, as implemented in cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and Soar \cite{Anderson2007HowCanThe,Laird2012TheSoarCognitive}.
Of particular interest to this paper are the declarative long-term memory (LTM) processes, which we describe below.

Formally, the contents of LTM is an edge-labeled directed graph, defined by the tuple $\tuple{S, P, L, E}$:
$S$ the set of entities or concepts (we use these terms interchangeably), which corresponds to the internal nodes of the graph;
$P$ the set of predicates, which corresponds to the edge labels of the graph;
$L$ the set of literals, such as numbers and strings, which corresponds to the leaf nodes of the graph;
and $E{\subset}S{\times}P{\times}O$, where $O=S{\cup}L$, the set of \emph{triples}, which correspond to the directed edges of the graph from $s{\in}S$ to $o{\in}O$ with label $p{\in}P$.
For convenience, we will refer to the elements of a triple $\tuple{s, p, o}$ as the \emph{subject}, the \emph{predicate}, and the \emph{object} respectively.

An agent has two ways of getting knowledge from LTM.
First, for any entity $s$, the agent can \emph{retrieve} all outgoing edges $\setof{\tuple{s, p, o}{\in}E}$ for which that entity is the subject.
This mechanism is for accessing related information of a known concept, but to find an unknown concept that has certain properties, the agent must \emph{query} LTM instead.
To do so, the agent must create a query \emph{cue} $Q = \setof{q{\in}P{\times}O}$, which describes the predicates and corresponding objects of the desired entity $s$ such that $\tuple{s, p, o}{\in}E \; \forall \tuple{p, o}{\in}Q$.
If more than one such entity exists, the entities with higher \emph{base-level activation} are preferentially returned.
Base-level activation is determined by $A(s) = \ln (\sum {t_i^{-d}})$, where $t_i$ is the time since the entity $s$ was last retrieved, and $d$ is the decay rate parameter.
Activation thus captures the recency and frequency of use of a concept, and is often used as a proxy of its relative importance to the agent.
\fixme[Talk about query vs. retrievals here]{}

Within this framework, we can define the general process through which an FOK might be generated.
When the agent is presented with a question, the agent would execute a sequence of queries and retrievals to LTM to attempt to answer the question.
For clarity, we call the answer to the overarching question the \emph{target} of the question, while an individual query will have a \emph{result} (the entity that is returned) out of a set of \emph{potential results} (other entities that match the cue).
Each query and retrieval executed by the agent will affect the agent's overall FOK towards the question.
We are interested in the computational processes that occur at each query, and how they affect the overall FOK.
Without loss of generality, we further define the FOK to be a real number between -1 and 1; this allows the agent to understand whether an FOK is high or low in an absolute sense, without \fixme[I'm not sure how that would work]{the need for comparison against other FOKs}.

A quick note on terminology: the term \emph{retrieval} is overloaded in both psychology and cognitive architecture literature to sometimes mean both queries (with a cue) and retrievals (of a known concept in LTM).
Retrieval will be used in the psychological sense in this paper; we will disambiguate the term as needed when talking about the specific computational mechanism.

\section{Psychological Sources of FOK}

This section explores how existing hypothesized sources of feelings of knowing might be calculated within the common model.
Within the psychology literature, there are three main sources of FOK: cue familiarity, accessibility, and competition.
For each, we first discuss the relevant psychological literature, before evaluating how that may be translated computationally into a common model LTM.
A summary of these sources can be found in Table \ref{sources}.
We leave the evaluation of these models to its own section afterwards.

\subsection{Cue Familiarity}

As the name implies, the \emph{cue familiarity} account of FOK focuses on the contribution of the search cue to the feeling of knowing \cite{Reder1992WhatDeterminesInitial,Metcalfe1993TheCueFamiliarity,Koriat2001TheCombinedContributions}.
For the purpose of this paper, we include all FOK sources that are based on the semantic meaning of the cue, including familiarity and domain knowledge \cite{Schwartz1994SourcesOfInformation}.
The intuition behind this account is that FOK is a summarization of the amount of knowledge the agent might have about the topic, as estimated from the terms of the question.
The more the agent is familiar/knowledgeable about the concepts in the question, the more likely that they will know the answer, and therefore the higher the FOK.

From the computational standpoint, an FOK based on cue familiarity must be a function of the cue $Q = \setof{\tuple{p, o}{\in}P{\times}O}$.
We consider two ways in which the ``familiarity'' of the cue is calculated as a summary statistic, either of the base-level activation of the objects in the cue, or of the connectivity of those objects.
Although the choice of summary statistic may affect the FOK calculation --- the mean will be more sensitive to outlier values than the median, for example --- we consider this detail too low level for this paper, and will simply use $\phi$ to indicate that \fixme{it is a feature}.
It is an open question whether other the distribution of the \fixme{values}, such as its variance, play a role in FOK.

\subsubsection{Activation}

One possible metric for the familiarity of the cue is the activation of each individual object in the cue.
Since activation reflects the recency and frequency of \fixme{use} of a concept, this \fixme{calculation} therefore reflects how often the topic has arisen, hence the agent's familiarity with those concepts.
Formally, this FOK is defined as:

$$\phi\left(A(o_1), A(o_2), ..., A(o_n)\right) \; \forall {\tuple{p, o}{\in}Q}$$

An additional scaling factor, such as dividing by the sum or mean of all entities in LTM, may be necessary to \fixme{reduce the range of the result}.

\subsubsection{Connectivity}

In contrast to activation, connectivity captures how much knowledge the agent might have of each component of the cue.
A concept in which an agent is knowledgeable would be connected to many other concepts, while a concept of which the agent is ignorant would only be sparsely connected.
In the extreme, the simple presence or absence of the concept (i.e., whether the agent recognizes the concept) may be a sufficient signal to terminate search, and it has been shown that recognition is \fixme{beneficial} to knowledge search \cite{Li2012FunctionalInteractionsBetween}.

The fan of a concept in LTM defines its connectivity, although variations on this metric is possible.
First, it may be meaningful to only consider the fan-in or fan-out of the concept, which represent \fixme{FIXME}.
Second, a broader sense of connectivity may be include not only the immediate neighbors of the concept, but neighbors up to some graph distance away (whose weight may be attenuated based on the inverse of that distance).
Again, we leave these implementation details as future work, and leave the precise meaning of the $\text{fan}(s{\in}S)$ function undefined.
Formally, this FOK is defined as:

$$\phi\left(\text{fan}(o_1), \text{fan}(o_2), ..., \text{fan}(o_n)\right) \; \forall {\tuple{p, o}{\in}Q}$$

\fixme[Are there other cue-related sources worth mentioning, eg. recognition?]{}

\subsection{Accessibility}

% Koriat1993HowDoWe: These include activations from the terms in the question; structural, contextual, and semantic attributes; fragments of the target; and so on.
\comment{
    unlike cur familiarity, only available during and after retrieval
        "byproducts" of the retrieval process \cite{Koriat1993HowDoWe}
    more generally, we consider any attributes of the result of a query
}

\subsubsection{Activation}

As with the activation of the cue, the activation of the result of a retrieval may be a source of FOK.
Beyond representing the recency and frequency of use and therefore whether the concept is familiar, however, activation in this context also determines the fluency of the retrieval: the higher the activation, the more quickly the retrieval occurs \cite{Anderson2004AnIntegratedTheory}.
Fluency is cited as another source of FOK, but we consider it as equivalent to the activation of the retrieved result under the ACT-R framework.

Relative Activation FOK measures how frequently and recently a node has been accessed compared to all other items in memory.

$$\bar{A}_S = \frac {\sum_{s{\in}S} {A(s)}}{|S|}$$

$$\text{RelCueActFOK}(Q) = \sum_{<p, s> \in Q} (s) \ln(\frac{A(s)}{\bar{A}_S})$$

$$\text{RelTargetActFOK}(s{\in}S) = \ln(\frac{A(s)}{\bar{A}_S})$$

$$\text{RelActFOK}(Q, s) =
\begin{cases}
    \text{RelCueAct}(Q) & {if |Q| > 0} \\
    \text{RelTargetAct}(s)& {if |Q| = 0} \\
\end{cases}
$$

\subsubsection{Connectivity}

Relative Outgoing Edges FOK measures how much more is known about the cue compared to all other items in memory, where “how much is known” is determined by the number of outgoing edges from a node.

% does Q need to be defined in each equation before it is used?
$TotalAvgNumEdges = \frac{|P|}{|S|}$

$\text{OutEdges}(s) = \{p : \exists o{\in}O, <s, p, o>{\in}E \}$

$$RelOutEdgesFOK(s) =
\begin{cases}
    \ln (\frac{|OutEdges(s \in Q)|}{TotalAvgNumEdges}) & {if |Q| > 0} \\
    \exists o{\in}O, \exists p{\in}P, <s, p, o>{\in}E, \ln(\frac{|OutEdges(o)|}{TotalAvgNumEdges}) & {if |Q| = 0} \\
\end{cases}
$$

(From [Schreiber1998TheRelationBetween])
Competition 2 FOK is based on the idea that the more possible right answers there are, the more distractors there will be, making it more difficult to identify the correct answer. So, in contrast to Outgoing Edges FOK, the more outgoing edges from a node the lower the FOK.
% I'm not sure if these sums are correct/ what should go on top
\noindent$$Competition2FOK(s) =
\begin{cases}
    \exists o{\in}O, \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{s: <s, p, o> \in E} {|OutEdges(s)|}} & {if |Q| > 0} \\
    \exists o{\in}O, \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{o: <s, p, o> \in E} {|OutEdges(o)|}} & {if |Q| = 0} \\
\end{cases}
$$

\section{Dynamic FOK}

borrowing from TOT research, question of whether the same retrieval failure process leads to FOK, or if it's a post-hoc diagnostic process ([Schwartz2011TipOfThe])
pre- and post-retrieval accounts ([Florer2000FeelingsOfKnowing]) muddled in dynamic FOK

\subsubsection{Result-based Sources}

\subsubsection{State-State-based Sources}

For relative activation, outgoing edges, activation over edges 2, competition 2, and absolute activation FOKs, calculations were made based on the cue for queries and the target for retrievals.

For the historic FOK calculation, we first calculated the weighted average of past FOKs (gamma of 0.48), found the new differences between the most recent FOK and the previous one, then took another weighted averages of these new differences. (The comments in the code are unclear and some of it looks wrong? So it might be worth looking at again. I also have no idea why we chose a gamma of 0.48)

we used different FOK calculations based on where in the retrieval process the FOK occurred (using one method for a query and another method for subsequent retrievals)
